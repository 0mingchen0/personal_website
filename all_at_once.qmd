If you are ever curious about the title of pages, it is my all time favorite movie, here is one of my favorite scene from it:

What's the reference behind the website name? 

  - Nothing really, Malfunction is a cool word so I made my name a part of it

Is Mel your real name? 

  - No
  
Why don't you use your real name? 

  - Mel sounds cooler, also it makes it slightly more anonymous
  
But you have your real name and a picture of you in one of the projects... 

  - I know 

Did you draw the front page?

  - Yes
