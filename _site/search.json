I am currerntly about 50 points away, that is, about 6 wins away.\nI started playing chess when I was in elementary school. My parents brought me to the world of competitive chess because they believed I need a hobby! It is a little bit too much for the 9-year-old me, so I stopped playing after I gained this amazing thing named free will. That is, chess haven’t really crossed my mind during middle school and most of high school. However, as the worldwide pandemic took control of my social life, I slowly realized that the only online game I am good at – is chess. In reality, I started playing and enjoying chess around first year of college. Until now, I actively enjoy different chess variants, chess clubs, and getting to know people through chess."
