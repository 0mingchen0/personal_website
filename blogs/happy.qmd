  I've been interested in website and UI/UX design for the longest time. This website will be the one I use to test out new ideas, while getting a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Funny thing, this website is actually built in R studio with quarto. That is, I am using a statistical software to build my first official portfolio. 
Before this, I've used WordPress and various other non-coder friendly tools for website design.
